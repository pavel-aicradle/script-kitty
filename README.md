In the course of my work I end up writing little scripts that don't well belong to any larger project somewhat often. I don't really want to throw them away when I've finished using them for their targeted purpose, because I often want to reuse pieces or see how I did something later.

This repo gives these sorts of things a home. I've got it split up in to subdirectories with further readmes that hopefully point the way and explain what I was doing for each mini-project.
